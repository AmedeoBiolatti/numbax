# numbax

An experimental numba compiler for JAX

### Quickstart

*coming soon*: The decorator is not working yet but will be available soon.

```python
import jax
import numbax


@numbax.jit
def fn(x):
    return jax.numpy.sin(x) + 1


fn(1)
```

### Mini-benchmark

The mini-benchmark in `examples/minimal_example.py` returns the following times (in seconds)
